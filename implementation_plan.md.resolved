# Volatility + LLM Integration Plan

## Goal Description
Combine the Volatility 3 memory forensics framework with an LLM to allow users to perform memory analysis using natural language. The system will translate user queries into Volatility commands and interpret the results.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **LLM Provider**: This plan assumes the use of OpenAI's API (GPT-4o or similar) for best results. Please confirm if you have an API key or prefer a different provider (e.g., Anthropic, Local LLM).

> [!NOTE]
> **Memory Image**: Do you have a memory image to test with? If not, we will need to obtain a sample image for verification.

## Proposed Changes

### Project Structure
#### [NEW] [vol_llm.py](file:///c:/Users/asus/.gemini/antigravity/playground/stellar-cluster/vol_llm.py)
- Main script acting as the bridge.
- **Features**:
    - `generate_command(query, image_path)`: Prompts LLM with available plugins and user query to output a CLI command.
    - `execute_command(command)`: Runs the Volatility command.
    - `analyze_output(output, query)`: Feeds the raw text output back to the LLM for summarization and answering the specific question.
    - Interactive mode for continuous analysis.

#### [NEW] [requirements.txt](file:///c:/Users/asus/.gemini/antigravity/playground/stellar-cluster/requirements.txt)
- `volatility3`
- `openai` (or other SDKs based on preference)

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- None initially (prototype phase).

### Manual Verification
1.  **Setup**: Install dependencies.
2.  **Configuration**: Set `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3.  **Test Run**:
    ```bash
    python vol_llm.py --image <path_to_image> --query "List all running processes and highlight suspicious ones"
    ```
4.  **Validation**:
    - Verify the tool runs the correct `windows.pslist` or similar command.
    - Verify the LLM provides a coherent summary of the process list.
